"Socrates consisted of the genes his parents gave him, the experiences they and his environment later provided, and a growth and development mediated by numerous meals. For all I know, he may have been very successful in the evolutionary sense of leaving numerous offspring. His phenotype, nevertheless, was utterly destroyed by the hemlock and has never since been duplicated. The same argument holds also for genotypes. With Socrates' death, not only did his phenotype disappear, but also his genotype.[...] The loss of Socrates' genotype is not assuaged by any consideration of how prolifically he may have reproduced. Socrates' genes may be with us yet, but not his genotype, because meiosis and recombination destroy genotypes as surely as death." --\citet{Williams:66}
\end{quotation}
  
Individuals are temporary, their phenotypes are temporary, and their genotypes are temporary. However, the alleles that individuals transmit across generations have permanence. Sustained phenotypic evolutionary change due to natural selection occurs because of changes in the allelic composition of the population. To understand these changes, we need to understand how the frequency of alleles (genes) changes over time due to natural selection.  

As we have seen, natural selection occurs when there are differences between individuals in fitness. We may define fitness in various ways. Most commonly, it is defined with respect to the contribution of a phenotype or genotype to the next generation. 
Differences in fitness can arise at any point during the life cycle. For instance, different genotypes or phenotypes may have different survival probabilities from one stage in their life to the stage of reproduction (viability), or they may differ in the number of offspring produced (fertility), or both. Here, we define the absolute fitness of a genotype as the expected number of offspring of an individual of that genotype. Differences in fitness among genotypes drive allele frequency change. In this chapter we'll study the dynamics of alleles at a single locus. In this chapter we'll ignore the effects of genetic drift, and just study the deterministic dynamics of selection. We'll return to discuss the interaction of selection and drift in the next chapter.\\


\subsection{Haploid selection model}
We start out by modeling selection in a haploid model, as this is mathematically relatively simple.
Let the number of individuals carrying alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ in generation $t$ be $P_t$ and $Q_t$. Then, the relative frequencies at time $t$ of alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ are $p_t = P_t / (P_t + Q_t)$ and $q_t = Q_t / (P_t + Q_t) = 1 - p_t$. Further, assume that individuals of type $A_1$ and $A_2$ on average produce $W_1$ and $W_2$ offspring individuals, respectively. We call $W_i$ the absolute fitness.\\


Therefore, in the next generation, the absolute number of carriers of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are $P_{t+1} = W_1 P_t$ and $Q_{t+1} = W_2 Q_t$, respectively. The mean absolute fitness of the population at time $t$ is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:meanAbsFit}
	\Wbar_t = W_1 \frac{P_t}{P_t + Q_t} + W_2 \frac{Q_t}{P_t + Q_t} = W_1 p_t + W_2 q_t,	
\end{equation}
i.e.\ the sum of the fitness of the two types weighted by their
relative frequencies. Note that the mean fitness depends on time, as
it is a function of the allele frequencies, which are themselves time
dependent. \\

As an example of a rapid response to selection on an allele in a haploid population, we can consider some data on the evolution of drug resistant viruses. \citet{feder2017} studied viral dynamics in a macaque infected with a strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) that carries the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase coding region. \marginnote{The main focus of \citeauthor{feder2017}'s work was modeling the complicated spatial dynamics of drug-resistant SHIV adaptation in different organ systems. } The viral load of the macaque's blood plasma is shown as a black line in Figure \ref{fig:HIV_viral_freqs}. Twelve weeks after infection, the macaque was treated with an anti-retroviral drug that targeted the the virus' reverse transcriptase protein. Note how the viral load initially starts to drop once the drug is administered, suggesting that the absolute fitness of the original strain is less than one ($W_{2}<1$) in the presence of the drug (as their numbers are decreasing). However, the viral population rebounds as a mutation  that confers drug resistance to the anti-retroviral drug arises in the SHIV and starts to spread. Viruses carrying this mutation (let's call them allele $1$) likely have absolute fitness $W_1>1$. The frequency of the drug-resistant allele is shown in red; it quickly spreads from being undetectable in week 13, to being fixed in the SHIV population in week 20.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{Journal_figs/single_locus_selection/Feder_HIV/Feder_HIV.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{} \label{fig:HIV_viral_freqs}
\end{figure}
The rapid spread of this drug-resistant allele through the population is driven by the much greater relative fitness of the drug-resistant allele over the original strain in the presence of the anti-retroviral drug. 

The frequency of allele $A_1$ in the next generation is given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:eq:recHaplMod1}
	p_{t+1} = \frac{P_{t+1}}{P_{t+1} + Q_{t+1}} = \frac{W_1 P_t}{W_1 P_t + W_2 Q_t}
	%= \frac{W_1 (P_t + Q_t)p_t}{W_1 (P_t + Q_t)p_t + W_2 (P_t + Q_t)q_t}
	= \frac{W_1 p_t}{W_1 p_t + W_2 q_t} = \frac{W_1}{\Wbar_t} p_t.
\end{equation}

Importantly, eqn.\ (\ref{eq:eq:recHaplMod1}) tells us that the change in $p$ only depends on a ratio of fitnesses. Therefore, we need to specify fitness only up to an arbitrary constant. As long as we multiply all fitnesses by the same value, that constant will cancel out and eqn.\ (\ref{eq:eq:recHaplMod1}) will hold. Based on this argument, it is very common to scale absolute fitnesses by the absolute fitness of one of the genotypes, e.g.\ the most or the least fit genotype, to obtain relative fitnesses. Here, we will use $w_i$ for the relative fitness of genotype $i$. If we choose to scale by the absolute fitness of genotype $A_1$, we obtain the relative fitnesses $w_1 = W_1/W_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = W_2/W_1$.\\
Without loss of generality, we can therefore rewrite eqn.\ (\ref{eq:eq:recHaplMod1}) as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:recHaplMod2}
	p_{t+1} = \frac{w_1}{\wbar} p_t,
\end{equation}
dropping the subscript $t$ for the dependence of the mean fitness on time in our notation, but remembering it.
The change in frequency from one generation to the next is then given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta p_t = p_{t+1} - p_t= \frac{ w_1 p_t}{ \wbar} - p_t = \frac{w_1 p_t - \wbar p_t}{\wbar} = \frac{w_1 p_t - (w_1 p_t + w_2 q_t) p_t}{\wbar} = \frac{w_1 - w_2}{\wbar} p_t q_t,
\label{eq:deltap_haploid}
\end{equation}
recalling that $q_t = 1 - p_t$.\\

Assuming that the fitnesses of the two alleles are constant over time,
the number of the two allelic types $\tau$ generations after time $t$ are
$P_{t+\tau} = (W_1)^{\tau} P_t$ and $Q_{t+\tau}=  (W_2)^{\tau} Q_t$, respectively. Therefore, the relative frequency of allele $A_1$ after $\tau$ generations past $t$ is
\begin{equation}
	p_{t+\tau} = \frac{ (W_1)^{\tau} P_t}{ (W_1)^{\tau} P_t+(W_2)^{\tau} Q_t} = \frac{ (w_1)^{\tau} P_t}{ (w_1)^{\tau} P_t+(w_2)^{\tau} Q_t} = \frac{p_t}{p_t + (w_2/w_1)^{\tau} q_t},
	\label{eq:haploid_tau_gen}
\end{equation}
where the last step includes dividing the whole term by $(w_1)^{\tau}$ and switching from absolute to relative allele frequencies.\\

Rearranging eqn.\ \eqref{eq:haploid_tau_gen} and setting $t = 0$, we can work out the time $\tau$ for the frequency of $A_1$ to change from $p_0$ to $p_{\tau}$. First, we write
\begin{equation}
	p_{\tau} = \frac{p_0}{p_0 + (w_2/w_1)^{\tau} q_0}
\end{equation}
and rearrange this to obtain
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:estTau}
	\frac{p_{\tau}}{q_{\tau}} = \frac{p_0}{q_0} \left(\frac{w_1}{w_2}\right)^{\tau}.
\end{equation}
Solving this for $\tau$ yields
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:solTau}
	\tau = \log \left(\frac{p_{\tau} q_0}{q_{\tau} p_0}\right) /  \log\left(  \frac{w_1}{w_2} \right).
\end{equation}
\\

In practice, it is often helpful to parametrize the relative fitnesses $w_i$ in a specific way. For example, we may set $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 1 - s$, where $s$ is called the selection coefficient. Using this parametrization, $s$ is simply the difference in relative fitnesses between the two alleles. Equation \eqref{eq:haploid_tau_gen} becomes
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:haploid_tau_gen_expl}
	p_{t+\tau} = \frac{p_{t}}{p_{t} + q_{t} (1 - s)^{\tau}},
\end{equation}
as $w_2 / w_1 = 1 - s$. Then, if $s \ll 1$, we can approximate $(1-s)^{\tau}$ in the denominator by $\exp(-s\tau)$ to obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:haploid_logistic growth}
	p_{t+\tau} \approx \frac{p_t}{p_t + q_t e^{-s\tau}}.
\end{equation}
This equation takes the form of a logistic function. That is because
we are looking at the relative frequencies of two `populations' (of
alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$) that are growing (or declining)
exponentially, under the constraint that $p$ and $q$ always sum to 1. \\

Moreover, eqn.\ \eqref{eq:estTau} for the number of generations $\tau$ it takes for a certain change in frequency to occur becomes
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:estTauExpl}
	\tau = - \log \left(\frac{p_{\tau} q_0}{q_{\tau} p_0}\right) /  \log\left(1-s\right).
\end{equation}
Assuming again that $s \ll 1$, this simplifies to
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:estTauExplSimpl}
	\tau \approx \frac{1}{s} \log \left(\frac{p_{\tau} q_0}{q_{\tau} p_0}\right).
\end{equation}


One particular case of interest is the time it takes to go from an absolute
frequency of 1 to near fixation in a population of size $N$.  In this case, we
have $p_0 = 1/N$, and we may set $p_{\tau} = 1 - 1/N$, which is very close to
fixation. Then, plugging these values into eqn.\ \eqref{eq:estTauExplSimpl}, we
obtain

\begin{align}
  \tau &= \frac{1}{s} \log\left( \frac{1 - \nicefrac{2}{N} +
      \nicefrac{1}{N^2}}{\nicefrac{1}{N^2}} \right) \nonumber \\
  &\approx \frac{1}{s} (\log(N) + \log(N-2)) \nonumber \\
  &\approx \frac{2}{s} \log(N)  \label{eq:fixTimeSimpl}
\end{align}
%
where we make the approximations $N^2 - 2N + 1 \approx N^2 - 2N$ and later
$N-2 \approx N$.


\begin{question}
In our example of the evolution of drug resistance, the drug-resistant SHIV virus spread from undetectable frequencies to $\sim 65\%$ frequency by 16 weeks post infection. An estimated effective population size of SHIV is $1.5 \times 10^5$, and its generation time is $\sim 1$ day. Assuming that the mutation arose as a single copy allele very shortly the start of drug treatment at 12 weeks, what is the selection coefficient favouring the drug resistance allele?  
\end{question}




%\begin{question}
%You are studying the frequency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a

%resistance allele to be $99\%$. Assume a generation time of $\nicefrac{1}{4}$ a day for
%these bacteria. \\
%What is the selection coefficient associated with the resistance to antibiotics?
%\end{question}

\paragraph{Haploid model with fluctuating selection}
Selection pressures may change while a polymorphism persists in the population due to environmental changes. 
We can use our haploid model to consider this case where the fitnesses depend on time \citep{Dempster:55}, and
say that $w_{1,t}$ and $w_{2,t}$ are the fitnesses of the two types in
generation $t$. The frequency of allele $A_1$ in generation $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} = \frac{w_{1,t}}{\wbar_t} p_t,
\end{equation}
which simply follows from eqn.\ \eqref{eq:recHaplMod2}.
The ratio of the frequency of allele $A_1$ to that of allele $A_2$ in generation $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \frac{w_{1,t}}{w_{2,t}}  \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, if we think of the two alleles starting in generation $t$ at
frequencies $p_t$ and $q_t$, then $\tau$ generations later,
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+\tau}}{q_{t+\tau}} = \left(\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1} \frac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}.
\end{equation}
\\

The question of which allele is increasing or decreasing in frequency comes down
to whether $\left(\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1} \nicefrac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right)$ is
$>1$ or $<1$. As it is a little hard to think about this ratio, we can
instead take the $\tau^{\mathrm{th}}$ root of it and consider
\begin{equation}
\sqrt[\tau]{\left(\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1} \frac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right)} = \frac{\sqrt[\tau]{\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1}w_{1,i}}}{\sqrt[\tau]{\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1}w_{2,i}}}.
\end{equation}
The term $\sqrt[\tau]{\prod_{i=t}^{\tau-1}w_{1,i}}$ is the geometric mean fitness of allele
 $A_1$ over the $\tau$ generations past generation $t$. Therefore, allele $A_1$ will only increase
in frequency if it has a higher geometric mean fitness than allele $A_2$
(at least in our simple deterministic model). \\

\subsection{Diploid model}

\begin{marginfigure}

\end{marginfigure}

We will now move on to a diploid model of a single locus with two segregating alleles. As an example of the change in the frequency of an allele driven by selection, lets consider the evolution of Lactase persistence. A number of different human populations that historically have raised cattle have convergently evolved to maintain the expression of the protein Lactase into adulthood (in most mammals the protein is switched off after childhood), with different lactase-persistence mutations having arisen and spread in different pastoral human populations. 
This continued expression of Lactase allows adults to break down Lactose, the main carbohydrate in milk, and so benefit nutritionally from milk-drinking. This seems to have offered a strong fitness benefit to individuals in pastoral populations. 


With the advent of techniques to sequence ancient human DNA, researchers can now potentially track the frequency of selected mutations over thousands of years. The frequency of a Lactase persistence allele in ancient Central European populations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:LCT_freqs}. The allele is absent more than 5,000 years ago, but now found at frequency of upward of $70\%$ in many European populations. 


We will assume that the difference in fitness between the three
genotypes comes from differences in viability, i.e.\ differential
survival of individuals from the formation of zygotes to reproduction.  
We denote the absolute fitnesses of genotypes $A_1A_1$, $A_1A_2$, and $A_2A_2$ by $W_{11}$, $W_{12}$, and $W_{22}$. Specifically, $W_{ij}$ is the probability that a zygote of genotype $A_iA_j$ survives to reproduction.
Assuming that individuals mate at random, the number of zygotes that are of the three genotypes and form generation $t$ are
\begin{equation}
Np_t^2, ~~~  N2p_tq_t, ~~~ Nq_t^2.
\end{equation}

The mean fitness of the population of zygotes is then
\begin{equation}
	\Wbar_t = W_{11} p_t^2+W_{12} 2p_tq_t  +  W_{22} q_t^2.
\end{equation}
Again, this is simply the weighted mean of the genotypic fitnesses.
\\

How many zygotes of each of the three genotypes survive to reproduce? \erin{plot needs caption and title}
An individual of genotype $A_1A_1$ has a probability of $W_{11}$ of
surviving to reproduce, and similarly for other genotypes. Therefore, the expected number of $A_1A_1$, $A_1A_2$, and $A_2A_2$ individuals who survive to reproduce is
\begin{equation}
	NW_{11} p_t^2, ~~~ NW_{12} 2p_tq_t , ~~~ N W_{22} q_t^2.
\end{equation}
It then follows that the total number of individuals who survive to
reproduce is
\begin{equation}
	N \left(W_{11} p_t^2+W_{12} 2p_tq_t  +  W_{22} q_t^2 \right).
\end{equation}
This is simply the mean fitness of the population multiplied by the
population size (i.e.\ $N \wbar$).\\

The relative frequency of $A_1A_1$ individuals at reproduction
is simply the number of $A_1A_1$ genotype individuals at reproduction ($NW_{11} p_t^2$)
divided by the total number of individuals who survive to reproduce
($N \Wbar$), and likewise for the other two genotypes.
Therefore, the relative frequency of individuals with the three different genotypes at reproduction is
\begin{equation}
	\frac{NW_{11} p_t^2}{N\Wbar}, ~~~ \frac{NW_{12} 2p_tq_t}{N\Wbar} , ~~~ \frac{N W_{22} q_t^2}{N\Wbar}
\end{equation}
(see Table \ref{dip_fitness_table}).\\

As there is no difference in the fecundity of the three genotypes, the
allele frequencies in the zygotes forming the next generation are simply the
allele frequency among the reproducing individuals of the previous generation. Hence, the frequency of $A_1$ in generation $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
	p_{t+1} = \frac{W_{11} p_t^2 + W_{12} p_tq_t}{\Wbar}
	\label{pgen_dip}.
\end{equation}
\erin{it might help students understand this equation more to mention here that the expected 2 in 2pq is being cancelled out by the 1/2 for only one A1 allele in hets...or to just include that step though it's fairly trivial} Note that, again, the absolute value of the fitnesses is irrelevant to
the frequency of the allele. Therefore, we can just as easily replace
the absolute fitnesses with the relative fitnesses. That is, we may replace $W_{ij}$ by $w_{ij} = W_{ij}/W_{11}$, for instance. \\

Each of our genotype frequencies is responding to selection in a
manner that depends just on its fitness compared to the mean fitness
of the population. For example, the frequency of the $11$ homozygotes
increases from birth to adulthood in proportion to $\nicefrac{W_{11}}{\Wbar}$. In
fact, we can estimate this fitness ratio for each genotype by comparing
the frequency at birth compared to adults. As an example of this calculation, we'll
look at some data from sticklebacks.

Marine threespine stickleback ({\it Gasterosteus aculeatus})
independently colonized and adapted to many freshwater lakes

from predation, but freshwater populations repeatedly evolve the
loss of armour plates due to selection on an allele at the
Ectodysplasin gene (EDA).  This allele is found as a standing variant at very low frequency marine populations;
\citeauthor{Barrett:08} took advantage of this fact and collected and bred
a population of marine individuals carrying both the low- (L) and
completely- plated (C) alleles. They introduced the offspring of this

The heterozygotes have increased in frequency dramatically in the
population as their fitness is more than double the mean fitness of
the population. We can also calculate the relative fitness of each
genotype by dividing through by the fitness of the fittest genotype,
the heterozygote in this case (doing this cancels through
$\Wbar$). The relative fitness of the $CC$ is $\sim 1/5$ of the
heterozygote. Note that this calculation does not rely on the genotype frequencies being at their HWE in the juveniles.

\begin{question}
For many generations you have been studying an annual wildflower that has two color morphs, orange and white. You have discovered that a single bi-allelic locus controls flower color, with the white allele being recessive. The pollinator of these plants is an almost blind bat, so individuals are pollinated at random with respect to flower color. Your population census of 200 individuals showed that the population consisted of 168 orange-flowered individuals, and 32 white-flowered individuals.\\
Heavy February rainfall creates optimal growing conditions for an
exotic herbivorous beetle with a preference for orange-flowered
individuals.  This year it arrives at your study site with a ravenous
appetite.  Only 50\% of orange-flowered individuals survive its wrath,
while 90\% of white-flowered individuals survive until the end of the
growing season.  \\
%Additionally, surviving orange flowered individuals produce 80 seeds on average, while surviving white-flowered individuals produce 100 seeds on average. 
{\bf A} What is the initial frequency of the white allele, and what do you
have to assume to obtain this?\\
{\bf B} What is the frequency of the white allele in the seeds forming the next generation?\\
\end{question}


The change in frequency from generation $t$ to $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
\Delta p_t = p_{t+1} -p_{t}= \frac{w_{11} p_t^2 + w_{12} p_tq_t}{\wbar} - p_t. \label{deltap_dip1}
\end{equation}
To simplify this equation, we will first define two variables $\wbar_1$ and $\wbar_2$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\wbar_1 & = w_{11} p_t + w_{12} q_t, \\
	\wbar_2 & =  w_{12} p_t+ w_{22} q_t.
\end{eqnarray}
These are called the marginal fitnesses of allele $A_1$
and $A_2$, respectively. They are so called as $\wbar_1$ is the
average fitness of an allele $A_1$, i.e.\ the fitness of $A_1$ in a
homozygote weighted by the probability it is in a homozygote ($p_t$)
plus the fitness of $A_1$ in a
heterozygote weighted by the probability it is in a heterozygote ($q_t$).
We further note that the mean relative fitness can be expressed in terms of the marginal fitnesses as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:meanFitInTermsOfMargFit}
	\wbar = \wbar_1 p_t + \wbar_2 q_t,
\end{equation}
where, for notational simplicity, we have omitted subscript t for the dependence of mean and marginal fitnesses on time.\\

We can then rewrite eqn.\ \eqref{deltap_dip1} using $\wbar_1$ and $\wbar_2$ as
\begin{equation}
	\Delta p_t = \frac{ (\wbar_1-\wbar_2)}{\wbar} p_t q_t.
	\label{deltap_dip2}
\end{equation}
The sign of $\Delta p_t$, i.e. whether allele $A_1$ increases of decreases
in frequency, depends only on the sign of $(\wbar_1-\wbar_2)$.
The frequency of $A_1$ will keep increasing over the generations so
long as its marginal fitness is higher than that of $A_2$,
i.e.\ $\wbar_1 > \wbar_2$, while if $\wbar_1 < \wbar_2$, the
frequency of $A_1$ will decrease. Note the similarity between eqn.\ \eqref{deltap_dip2} and the respective expression for the haploid model in eqn.\ \eqref{eq:deltap_haploid}. (We will return to the
special case where $\wbar_1 = \wbar_2$ shortly).\\

We can also rewrite \eqref{deltap_dip1} as
\begin{equation}
\Delta p_t =\frac{1}{2} \frac{p_tq_t}{\wbar} \frac{d \wbar}{dp},
\label{deltap_dip3}
\end{equation}
the demonstration of which we leave to the reader.
This form shows that the frequency of $A_1$ will increase ($\Delta p_t > 0$) if the mean fitness is an increasing function of the frequency of $A_1$ (i.e.\ if $\frac{d \wbar}{dp}>0$). On the other hand, the frequency of $A_1$ will decrease ($\Delta p_t < 0$) if the mean fitness is a decreasing function of the frequency of $A_1$ (i.e.\ if $\frac{d \wbar}{dp}<0$).
%This form shows that
%$\Delta p_t$ in increase if $\frac{d \wbar}{dp}>1$, i.e. increasing the
%frequency of $1$ increases the mean fitness, while the frequency of

Thus, although selection acts on
individuals, under this simple model, selection is acting to increase
the mean fitness of the population. \sa{The rate of this increase is proportional to
the variance in allele frequencies within the population ($p_tq_t$).}\\

\end{question}

So far, our treatment of the diploid model of selection has been in terms of generic fitnesses $w_{ij}$. In the following, we will use particular parametrizations to gain insight about two specific modes of selection: directional selection and heterozygote advantage.

%%Selection coeffs in diploid model
\subsection{Diploid directional selection}
Directional selection means that one of the two alleles always has higher marginal fitness than the other one. Let us assume that $A_1$ is the fitter allele, so that $w_{11} \geq w_{12} \geq w_{22}$, and hence $\wbar_1 > \wbar_2$. As we are interested in changes in allele frequencies, we \sa{may use} relative fitnesses. We parameterize the reduction in relative fitness in terms of a selection coefficient, similar to the
one we met in the haploid selection section, as follows:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
genotype & $A_1A_1$ & $A_1A_2$ & $A_2A_2$ \\
absolute fitness & $W_{11}$ & $ \geq W_{12} \geq$ & $W_{22}$ \\
relative fitness (generic) & $w_{11} = W_{11}/W_{11}$ & $w_{12} = W_{12}/W_{11}$ & $w_{22} = W_{22}/W_{11}$ \\
relative fitness  (specific) & $1$ & $1-sh$ & $1-s$. \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
Here, the selection coefficient $s$ is the difference in relative
fitness between the two homozygotes, and $h$ is the
dominance coefficient. \sa{For selection to be directional, we require that $0 \leq h \leq 1$ holds. The dominance coefficient allows us to move between two extremes. One is when $h = 0$, such that allele $A_1$ is fully dominant and $A_2$ fully recessive. In this case, the heterozygote $A_1A_2$ is as fit as the $A_1A_1$ homozgyote genotype. The inverse holds when $h = 1$, such that allele $A_1$ is fully recessive and $A_2$ fully dominant.}\\

Throughout the Californian foothills are old copper and gold-mines, which have dumped out soils that are polluted with heavy metals. While these toxic mine tailing are often depauperate of plants,  {\it Mimulus guttatus} and a number of other plant species have managed to adapt to these harsh soils. \citet{wright2015adaptation} have mapped one of the major loci contributing to the adaptation to soils at two mines near Copperopolis, CA. \citeauthor{wright2015adaptation} planted homozygote seedlings out in the mine tailings, he found that only $10\%$ of the homozygotes for the non-copper-tolerant allele survived to flower, while $40\$$ of the copper-tolerant seedlings survived to flower.\\

\end{figure}
To see how dominance affects the trajectory of a real
polymorphism, we'll consider an example from a colour polymorphism in
red foxes ({\it Vulpes vulpes}). There are three colour morphs of red foxes: silver, cross, and
red (see Figure \ref{fig:Fox_morphs}), with this difference primarily
controlled by a single polymorphism with genotypes RR, Rr, and rr respectively. The fur pelts of the silver morph
fetched three times the price for hunters compared to cross (a smoky red) and red
pelts, the latter two being seen as roughly equivalent in worth. Thus
the desirability of the pelts acts as a recessive trait, with much
stronger selection against the silver homozygotes.  As a
result of this price difference, silver foxes were hunted more
intensely and declined as a proportion of the population in Eastern Canada, see Figure
\ref{fig:Fox_morph_freqs}, as documented by \citeauthor{elton:42},
from $16\%$ to $5\%$ from 1834 to 1937.
\citeauthor{haldane:42} reanalyzed these data and showed that they
were consistent with recessive selection acting against the silver
morph alone. \begin{marginfigure}

\end{marginfigure} Note how the heterozygotes (cross) decline somewhat as a
result of selection on the silver homozygotes, but overall the R
allele is slow to respond to selection as it is `hidden' from
selection in the heterozygote state.

\graham{Add selection lines or get students to do that as an exercise.}


\paragraph{Directional selection on an additive allele.}
A special case is when $h = 0.5$. This case is the case of no dominance, as the interaction among alleles with respect to fitness is strictly additive. Then, eqn.\ \eqref{deltap_direct} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
	\Delta p_t = \frac{1}{2}\frac{s}{\wbar}p_tq_t .
	\label{deltap_add}
\end{equation}


If selection is very weak, i.e.\ $s \ll 1$, the denominator ($\wbar$) is close to $1$ and we have
\begin{equation}
	\Delta p_t = \frac{1}{2} s p_t q_t .
	\label{deltap_add_simpl}
\end{equation}
It is instructive to compare eqn.\ \eqref{deltap_add_simpl} to the respective expression under the haploid model. To this purpose, start from the generic term for $\Delta p_t$ under the haploid model in eqn.\ \eqref{eq:deltap_haploid} and set $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 1-s$. Again, assume that $s$ is small, so that eqn.\ \eqref{eq:deltap_haploid} becomes $\Delta p_t = s p_t q_t$. Hence, if $s$ is small, the diploid model of directional selection without dominance is identical to the haploid model, up to a factor of $1/2$. That factor is due to the choice of the parametrisation; we could have set $w_{11} = 1$, $w_{12} = 1-s$, and $w_{22} = 1-2s$ in our diploid model instead, in which case the agreement with the haploid model would be perfect.\\

From this analogy, we can borrow some insight we gained from the haploid model. Specifically, the trajectory of the frequency of allele $A_1$ in the diploid model without dominance follows a logistic growth curve similar to \eqref{eq:haploid_logistic growth}. From this similarity, we can extrapolate from Equation \eqref{eq:estTauExplSimpl} to find the time it takes for our diploid, beneficial, additive allele ($A_1$) to move from frequency $p_0$ to $p_{\tau}$ as
\begin{equation}
	\tau \approx \frac{2}{s} \log \left(\frac{p_{\tau} q_0}{q_{\tau} p_0}\right)
\end{equation}
generations, this just differs by a factor of $2$ from our haploid model. Using this result we can find the time it takes for our favourable, additive allele ($A_1$) to transit from its entry into the population ($p_0 =1/(2N)$)
to close to fixation ($p_{\tau} =1-1/(2N)$) as 
\begin{equation}
	\tau \approx \frac{4}{s} \log(2N)  \label{eq:diploid_fix_time}
\end{equation}
generations. Note the similarity to eqn.\ \ref{eq:fixTimeSimpl} for the haploid model, with a difference
by a factor of 2 due to the choice of parametrization 
(and that the number of alleles is $2N$ in the diploid model, rather than $N$). Doubling our selection coefficient, halves the time it takes for our allele to move through the population.\\

Gulf killifish ({\it Fundulus grandis}) have rapidly adapted to the very high pollution levels in the Houston shipping canal since the 1950s. One of the ways that they've adapted is through the deletion of their aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene. Oziolor et al. estimated that individuals who were homozygote for the intact AHR gene had a relative fitness of 20\% of that of homozygotes for the deletion. Assuming an effective population size of 200 thousand individuals, how long would it take for the deletion to reach fixation?

%\end{question}
%\end{tcolorbox}

Directional selection on genotypes is expected to remove variation
from populations, yet we see plentiful phenotypic and genetic
variation in every natural population, why is this? Three broad
explanations for the maintainance of polymorphisms are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variation is maintained by a balance of genetic drift and
  mutation (we discussed this explanation in Chapter
  \ref{Chapter:Drift}).
  \item Selection can sometimes act to maintain variation in
    populations (balancing selection). 
    \item Deleterious variation can be maintained in the population as
      a balance between selection removing variation and mutation
      constantly introducing new variation into the population. 
\end{enumerate}
We'll turn to these latter two explanations through the rest of the
chapter. Note that theses explanations are not mutually exclusive, and all of them
will explain some proportion of the variation. 

\subsection{Heterozygote advantage}
One form of balancing selection occurs when the heterozygotes are fitter than either
of the homozygotes. In this case, it is useful to parameterize the relative fitnesses as follows:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	genotype & $A_1A_1$ & $A_1A_2$ & $A_2A_2$ \\
	absolute fitness & $w_{11}$ & $<w_{12}>$ & $w_{22}$ \\
	relative fitness (generic) & $w_{11}=W_{11}/W_{12}$ & $w_{12} = W_{12}/W_{12}$ & $w_{22} = W_{22}/W_{12}$ \\
	relative fitness (specific)  & $1-s_1$ & $1$ & $1-s_2$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}

Here, $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the differences between the relative fitnesses
of the two homozygotes and the heterozygote. Note that to obtain
relative fitnesses we have divided
absolute fitness by the heterozygote fitness. We could use the
same parameterization as in the model of directional selection, but the reparameterization we have chosen here makes the math easier.\\

In this case, when allele $A_1$ is rare, it is often found in a
heterozygous state, while the $A_2$ allele is usually in the
homozygote state and so the $A_1$ increases in frequency. However, when
allele $A_1$ is common, it is often found in the homozygote state, while
the allele $A_2$ is often found in the heterozygote state; it is
now $A_2$ that increases in frequency at the expense of allele
$1$. Thus, at least in the deterministic model, neither allele can
reach fixation and both alleles will be maintained as a balanced
polymorphism in the population at an equilibrium frequency. 


We can solve for this equilibrium frequency by setting $\Delta p_t = 0$ in  eqn.\ \eqref{deltap_dip2}, 
i.e.\ $p_tq_t (\wbar_1-\wbar_2)=0$. Doing so, we find that there are three equilibria, all of which are stable. Two of them are not very interesting ($p=0$ or $q=0$), but the third one is the polymorphic equilibrium,  where
$\wbar_1=\wbar_2$ holds.
Using our $s_1$ and $s_2$ parametrization above, we see that the marginal fitnesses of
the two alleles are equal when
\begin{equation}
	p_e = \frac{s_2}{s_1+s_2}
\end{equation}
for the equilibrium frequency of interest. This is also the frequency
of $A_1$ at which the mean fitness of the population is maximised. The
highest possible fitness of the population would be achieved if every
individual was a heterozygote, however, Mendelian segregation of alleles in the
gametes of heterozygotes means that a sexual population can never
achieve a completely heterozygote population. This equilibrium
frequency represents an evolutionary compromise between the advantages
of the heterozygotes and the comparative costs of the two
homozygotes.\\

} \label{fig:Soay_fitness}
\end{figure}


One example of a polymorphism maintained by heterozygote advantage is
a horn-size polymorphism found in Soay sheep, a population of feral sheep on the island of Soay
(about 40 miles off the coast of Scotland).  The male sheep use their horns to defend females during
the rut. \citet{johnston2013life} found a large-effect locus,  at the
RXFP2 gene, to control much of the genetic variation for horn size. Two
alleles Ho$^p$ and Ho$^+$ segregate at this locus. The Ho$^+$ allele is associated with
growing larger horns. While the Hop allele is associated with smaller
horns, with a reasonable proportion of Ho$^p$ homozygotes developing no
horns at all. \citet{Johnston} found that the Ho locus had substantial
effect on male, but not female, fitness (see Figure
\citep{fig:Soay_fitness}). The Ho$^p$ allele has a mostly recessive effect on
male fecundity, with the Ho$^p$ homozygotes have lower yearly reproductive
success presumably due to the fact that they perform poorly in male-male
competition (left plot Figure \ref{fig:Soay_fitness}). Conversely the
Ho$^{+}$ has a mostly recessive effect on viability, with Ho$^{+}$ homozygotes having lower
yearly survival  (middle plot Figure \ref{fig:Soay_fitness}), likely because they spend little time feeding during
the rut and so lose substantial body weight. Thus both of the
homozygoats suffer their own tradeoffs between viability and
fecundity. As a result the Ho$^p$Ho$^+$ heterozygotes have the highest
fitness  (right plot Figure \ref{fig:Soay_fitness}).  The allele is
thus balanced at intermediate frequency ($~50\%$) in the population due to this trade off between life
history.

  the real soay sheep example, as a full model would
  requiire us to more carefully model the life-histories of the sheep. }

\end{figure}



To push our understanding of heterozygote advantage a little further, note that the 
marginal fitnesses of our alleles are the additive effects of our
alleles on fitness. Recall from our discussion of non-additive
variation (Section \ref{section:nonAddVar})
that the difference in the additive effects
of the two alleles gives the slope of the regression of additive
genotype on fitness, and that there is additive variance in fitness
when this slope is non-zero.  
So what's happening here in our heterozygote advantage model is that the fitness of the $A_1$ allele, the additive
effect of the allele on fitness, is
greater than the marginal fitness of the $A_2$ allele when it's at low
frequency in the population ($\bar{w}_1 > \bar{w}_2 $). In this case, the slope of the regression
of the number of $A_1$ alleles in a genotype on fitness is positive. This situation when the
frequency of the $A_1$ allele is above the equilibrium frequency. Then
the marginal fitness of $A_2$ is higher than the $A_1$ allele
($\bar{w}_1 < \bar{w}_2 $), and the regression of fitness on the number of copies
of the $A_1$ allele that individuals carry is negative. In both cases
there's additive genetic variance for fitness ($V_A > 0$) and the population has a
directional response.   Only when the
population is at its equilibrium frequency, when $\bar{w}_1 =
\bar{w}_2$, is there no additive genetic variance  ($V_A = 0$) as the
linear regression of genotype on fitness is zero. 





\paragraph{Underdominance.} Another case that is of potential interest is the case of fitness
underdominance, where the heterozygote is less fit than either of the
homozygotes. This can be parametrized as follows: \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	genotype & $A_1A_1$ & $A_1A_2$ & $A_2A_2$ \\
	absolute fitness & $w_{11}$ & $>w_{12}<$ & $w_{22}$ \\
	relative fitness (generic) & $w_{11}=W_{11}/W_{12}$ & $w_{12} = W_{12}/W_{12}$ & $w_{22} = W_{22}/W_{12}$ \\
	relative fitness (specific)  & $1+s_1$ & $1$ & $1+s_2$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}

This case also permits three equilibria, $p=0$, $p=1$, and a
polymorphic equilibrium $p=p_U$. However,
now only the first two equilibria are stable, while the polymorphic
equilibrium is unstable. If $p<p_U$ then $\Delta p_t $ is negative
and allele $A_1$ will be lost, while if $p>p_U$, allele
$A_1$ will become fixed.\\

While such alleles might not spread within populations (if $p_U \gg
0$ and selection is reasonably strong), they are of interest in the study of speciation and hybrid
zones. That is because alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ may have arisen in a
stepwise fashion, i.e.\ not by a single mutation, in separate
subpopulations. Now, heterozygote disadvantage will play a
potential role in species maintenance, if isolation of the subpopulations is not complete.\\

The homozygotes for the alternative allele (bb) fly very quickly indeed, but often die of exhaustion, with only 10\% of them making it to reproduction.  \\

\paragraph{Diploid fluctuating fitness}

Selection pressures fluctuate over time, and can potentially
maintain polymorphisms in the population. Two examples of polymorphisms
fluctuating in frequency in response to temporally-varying selection
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Droso_fluct}; thanks to the short
lifespan of {\it Drosophila} we can see seasonally-varying selection. The first is an inversion
allele in {\it Drosophila pseudoobscura}, in {\it D. pseudoobscura}
populations. Throughout western North America two orientations of the
chromosome, two inversion alleles, exist: the Chiricahua and Standard
alleles. \citeauthor{wright:46}
\graham{need earlier Dob. ref IX} investigated their frequency over
four years at a number of locations, and found that their frequency
fluctuated systematically over the seasons in response to
selection. Our second example is an insertion-deletion polymorphism in
the Insulin-like Receptor gene. \citeauthor{paaby:14} tracked the
frequency of this allele over a number of seasons, and found it
oscillated over the seasons. She and her coauthors also determined that these alleles had large effects on
traits such as developmental time and fecunity, which could mediate
the maintainance of this polymorphism through life-history trade-offs.

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{  } \label{fig:Droso_fluct} 
\end{figure}

To explore temporal fluctuations in fitness we'll need to
think about the diploid absolute fitnesses being time-dependent; where the three genotypes  have fitnesses
$w_{11,t}$, $w_{12,t}$, and $w_{22,t}$ in generation $t$. Modeling
this case full is much less tractable than the haploid case, as segregation
makes it tricky to keep track of the genotype frequencies.  
We can make some progress and gain some intuition by thinking about
how the frequency of allele $A_1$ changes when it is rare
\citep[following the work of ][]{haldane1963}.\\


% (This argument is originally due to Haldane and J. )\\

When $A_1$ is rare, i.e.\ $p_t \ll 1$, its frequency in the next
generation \eqref{pgen_dip} can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} \approx \frac{w_{12}}{\wbar} p_t.
\end{equation}
To obtain this, we have ignored the $p_{t}^2$ term and assumed that $q_t \approx 1$ in the numerator.
Following a similar argument to approximate $q_{t+1}$, we can write
\begin{equation}
	\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \frac{w_{12,t}}{w_{22,t}}  \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}.
\end{equation}
Then, starting from out from $p_0$ and $q_0$ in generation $0$, $t+1$
generations later, we have
\begin{equation}
	\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \left( \prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{w_{12,i}}{w_{22,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{0}}{q_{0}}.
\end{equation}
From this, we can see, following our haploid argument from above, that
the frequency of allele $A_1$ will increase when rare only if
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t-1}w_{12,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t-1}w_{22,i}}}>1 \label{geometric_1wins},
\end{equation}
i.e. if the heterozygote has higher geometric mean fitness than the $A_2A_2$ homozygote.\\

The question now is, whether allele $A_1$ will approach fixation in the population,
or whether there are cases in which we can obtain a balanced polymorphism. To investigate that, we can simply repeat our analysis for $q \ll 1$, and see that in that case
\begin{equation}
	\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \left( \prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{w_{11,i}}{w_{12,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{0}}{q_{0}}.
\end{equation}
Now, for allele $A_1$ to carry on increasing in frequency and to
approach fixation, the $A_1A_1$ genotype has to be
out-competing the heterozygotes. For allele $A_1$ to approach
fixation, we need the geometric mean of $w_{11,i}$ to be greater than the
geometric mean fitness of heterozygotes ($w_{12,i}$).
At the same time, if heterozygotes have higher geometric mean fitness than
the $A_1A_1$ homozygotes, then the $A_2$ allele will increase in frequency when it is rare.
Therefore, a balanced polymorphism can result when the heterozygote
has higher geometric fitness than either of the homozygotes.\\

%\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{11,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{22,i}}}>1
%\end{equation}
%implying that our $11$ homozygotes have to have higher geometric mean
%fitness than our heterozygotes.

%\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{11,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{22,i}}}<1  \label{geometric_2wins}
%\end{equation}
%(satisfying both \eqref{geometric_1wins} and
%\eqref{geometric_2wins}).

Intriguingly, we can have a balanced polymorphism even if the
heterozygote is never the fittest genotype in any generation, if the heterozygotes
has a higher geometric mean fitness than either of the homozygotes. In
this case, the polymorphism will remain balanced in the population, despite the fact that the heterozygote is never the fitest genotype.

\begin{tcolorbox} 
\begin{question}
OPTIONAL trickier question.\\
Imagine a randomly-mating population of hermaphrodites. In this
population a derived allele (D) segregates that distorts transmission
in its favour over the ancestral allele (d) in the production of all
the gametes of heterozygotes. The drive leads to a fraction $r$ of the gametes
of heterozygotes (D/d) to carry the D allele ($r>0.5$). The D allele
causes viability problems in the homozygote state such that the
relative fitnesses are $w_{dd}=1$, $w_{Dd}=1$, $w_{DD}=1-e$. The allele
is currently at frequency p in the population at birth. Assuming that the
population is very large and no mutation occurs:\\
{\bf A)}	What is the frequency of the D allele in the next generation, before selection has had a chance to act?\\
{\bf B)}	What conditions do you need for a polymorphic equilibrium to be maintained? At what is the equilibrium frequency of this balanced polymorphism?\\
{\bf C)}	Imagine the cost of the driver were additive
$w_{dd}=1$, $w_{Dd}=1-e$, $w_{DD}=1-2e$. Under what conditions can the driver invade the population? Can a polymorphic equilibrium be maintained?

\subsection{Mutation--selection balance}
%</source-file>
Mutation is constantly introducing new alleles into the
population. Therefore, variation can be maintained within a
population not only if selection is balancing (e.g.\ through heterozygote advantage or fluctuating selection over time, as we have seen in the previous section), but also due to a balance between
mutation introducing deleterious alleles and selection acting to purge
them from the population \citep{Haldane:37}. To study this balance, we return to the model of directional selection, where allele $A_1$ is advantageous, i.e.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
genotype & $A_1A_1$ & $A_1A_2$ & $A_2A_2$ \\
absolute fitness & $W_{11}$ & $ \geq W_{12} \geq$ & $W_{22}$ \\
relative fitness & $w_{11}=1$ & $w_{12}=1-sh$ & $w_{22}=1-s$. \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
We'll begin by considering the case where allele $A_2$ is not
completely recessive ($h>0$), so that the heterozygotes suffer at least some disadvantage. We denote by $\mu = \mu_{1\rightarrow2}$ the  mutation rate per generation from $A_1$ to the deleterious allele $A_2$, and assume that there is no reverse mutation ($\mu_{2\rightarrow1} = 0$).  Let us assume that selection against $A_2$ is relatively strong compared to the mutation rate, so that it is justified to assume that $A_2$ is always rare, i.e.\ $q_t = 1-p_t \ll 1$. Compared to previous sections, for mathematical clarity, we also switch from following the frequency $p_t$ of $A_1$ to following the frequency $q_t$ of $A_2$. Of course, this is without loss of generality. The change in frequency of $A_2$ due to selection can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\Delta_S q_t = \frac{\wbar_2 - \wbar_1}{\wbar} p_t q_t  \approx  -hs q_t.
	\label{eq:dirSelApprox}
\end{equation}
This approximation can be found by assuming that $q^2 \approx 0$, $p \approx 1$,
and that $\wbar \approx w_1$. \sa{All of these assumptions make sense if $q \ll 1$. From eqn.\ \eqref{eq:dirSelApprox} we see that selection acts to reduce the frequency of $A_2$ (as both $h$ and $s$ are positive), and it does so geometrically across the
generations. That is, if the initial frequency of $A_2$ is $q_0$, then its frequency at time $t$ is approximately 
\begin{equation}
	q_t = q_0 (1 - hs)^t.
	\label{eq:dirSelExplApprox}
\end{equation}

We will now consider the change in frequency induced by mutation. Recalling that $\mu$ is
the mutation rate from $A_1$ to $A_2$ per generation, the frequency of $A_2$ after mutation
\begin{equation}
	q^{\prime} =  \mu p_t + q_t = \mu(1 - q_t) + q_t.
\end{equation}
Assuming that $\mu \ll 1$ and that $q \ll 1$, the change in the
frequency of allele $A_2$ due to mutation ($\Delta_M q_t$) can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
	\Delta_M q_t = q^{\prime} - q_t =  \mu.
	\label{eq:mutApprox}
\end{equation}
Hence, when $A_2$ is rare and the mutation rate is low, mutation acts to linearly increase the frequency of the deleterious allele $A_2$.\\

If selection is to balance deleterious mutation, their combined effect over one generation has to be zero. Therefore, to find the mutation--selection equilibrium, we set
\begin{equation}
	\Delta_M q_t + \Delta_S q_t = 0,
\end{equation}
insert eqns. \eqref{eq:dirSelApprox} and \eqref{eq:mutApprox}, and solve for $q$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
	q_e = q_t = \frac{\mu}{hs}.
	\label{eqn:mut_sel_bal}
\end{equation}
We see that the frequency of the deleterious allele $A_2$ is balanced at the mutation rate ($\mu$) divided by
the reduction in relative fitness in the heterozygote ($hs$).}\\

It is worth pointing out that the fitness of the $A_2A_2$ homozygote
has not entered this calculation, as $A_2$ is so rare that it is hardly ever found in the 
homozygous state. Therefore, if $A_2$ has any deleterious effect
in a heterozygous state (i.e.\ if $h>0$) it is this effect that determines the
frequency at which $A_2$ is maintained in the population. Also, note that by
writing the total change in allele frequency as $\Delta_M q_t + \Delta_S q_t
$ we have implicitly assumed that we can ignore terms of order $\mu
\times s$. That is, we have assumed that there is no interaction between mutation and selection. We can do so as we assumed that both $\mu$ and $s$ are small.\\


If an allele was truly recessive (although few likely are), we have $h=0$, and
so eqn.\ \eqref{eqn:mut_sel_bal} is not valid. However, we can make an argument similar to the one above to show
that, for truly recessive alleles,
\begin{equation}
	q_e = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{s}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{question}
Oblong-winged katydids ({\it Amblycorypha oblongifolia}) are usually
% these are actually false katydid
green. However, some are bright pink, thanks to a erythrism
mutation (a nice example of an early Mendelian reasoning in a wonderful
titled paper\cite{Wheeler:07}). This condition is thought to be due to
a dominant mutation (\citet{Crew:13}). Assume that roughly
one in ten thousand is bright pink and that the mutation rate at the
gene underlying this condition is $10^{-5}$. What is the relative fitness of heterozygotes for the pink mutation? 
\end{question}



\paragraph{The genetic load of deleterious alleles}
What effect do such deleterious mutations at mutation--selection balance have on the population? It is common to express this effect in terms of a reduction of the mean relative fitness of the population. For a single site at which a deleterious mutation is segregating at $q_e = \mu/(hs)$, the mean relative fitness is reduced to
\begin{equation}
	\wbar = 1- 2p_e q_e hs - q_e^2s \approx 1-2\mu.
\end{equation}
Somewhat remarkably, the drop in mean fitness due to a site segregating
at mutation--selection balance is independent of the selection coefficient against the
heterozygote; it depends only the mutation rate. Note that this applies only if the mutation is not totally recessive, i.e.\ if $h > 0$.

A reduction of $1 - 2\mu$ is very small, given that the
mutation rate of a gene is likely $<10^{-5}$. However, if there are many loci
segregating at mutation--selection balance, this can accumulate to a substantial so-called
genetic load, and a major cause of variation in fitness-related traits
among individuals. For example, the human genome contains over twenty
thousand genes, and many other functional regions, the vast majority
of which will be subject to purifying selection against mutations that
disrupt their function. In humans most loss of function (LOF) variants, which severely
disrupt a protein-coding gene, are found at low frequencies. However, each human genome typically carries over
hundred LOF variants \citep{macarthur:12,lek:16}. Not every LOF allele will be
deleterious, some could be advantagous, but the combined load of these
LOF must on average lower our fitness, otherwise selection wouldn't be
removing them from the population. Each one of us
carries a unique set of these LOF alleles, usually in a heterozygote state. We differ slightly in how
many of these alleles we carry. For example the left side of Figure \ref{fig:LOF} shows
the distribution of number of LOF alleles carried by 769 individuals
of Dutch ancestry. The individuals who carry fewer of these LOF
alleles will on average have higher fitness than those individuals
with more.

\caption{{\bf Left)} The distribution of LOF alleles in 769 individuals from the
  Genome of the Netherlands project. Data from
  \citeauthor{francioli:14}. The average individual carries 144 LOF
  alleles. {\bf Right)}. The relative fitness of individuals carrying
  these varying numbers  of LOF alleles, assuming multiplicative
  selection and a selection coefficient of $sh=10^{-2}$ acting against
  these alleles \citep{cassa2017}.} \label{fig:LOF} 
\end{figure}

How do these differences mount up? Well if we are willing to assume
that this differences interact multiplicatively we can make some
progress. If an indvidual who carries one LOF mutation has a fitness
$1-hs$,  then individual who's heterzoygote for two LOF mutations would have
fitness $(1-hs)^2$, and an individual who is heterzoygote for $L$ LOF
alleles would have fitness  $(1-hs)^L$. The right-hand side of Figure
\ref{fig:LOF} shows the predicted fitness of individuals carrying
varying number of LOF alleles, relative to the mean
fitness of the sample, using this multiplicative model. Now we don't yet know how much lower the fitness of these
individuals really is, nor how most of these alleles manifest their fitness
consequences through disease and other mechanisms.  However, it's a
reasonable guess that this
variation, presumably maintained by mutation-selection balance, is
a major source of variation in fitness.

%\begin{tcolorbox} 
%\begin{question}
%You are studying an outbred population of mice living in a farmer’s field. Mutations occur at a gene called nurseryrhyme that cause a totally recessive form of blindness. These blind mice do not survive to reproduce as the farmer’s wife cuts off their tail (and other bits) with a carving knife. 
%Surveying the field for baby mice you find that 3 in ten thousand mice are blind.\\
%{\bf A} Assuming that the population mates at random, what is the mutation
% rate of blindness causing alleles?\\

%\%$ reduction in the viability of heterozygotes for these

%{\bf C)} Explain how and why your answers differ?
%\end{question}
%\end{tcolorbox}

%B) You look at family of outbred mice. You find that one of the mice in the family is blind, what is the probability that its 1st cousin is also blind?

%C) In another isolated field on the farm, there is a high rate of inbreeding among the mice. The farmer’s wife also carries out her cruel carving knife policy in this field as well. Do you expect to the underlying blindness mutations to be at a higher or low rate in this second field than the first field? Briefly explain your answer.


\subsection{Inbreeding depression}
All else being equal, eqn.\ \eqref{eqn:mut_sel_bal} suggests that mutations that have a smaller effect in the
heterozygote can segregate at higher frequency under mutation--selection balance. As a consequence, alleles that have
strongly deleterious effects in the homozygous state can segregate at
low frequencies in the population, as long as they do not have too 
strong a deleterious effect in heterozygotes. Thus, outbred populations may have many
alleles with recessive deleterious effects segregating within them.
\begin{question}
Assume that a deleterious allele has a relative fitness $.99$ in
heterozygotes and a relative fitness $0.2$. Assuming that the
deleterious allele is at a frequency $10^{-3}$ at birth the
genotype frequencies follow from HWE:\\
{\bf A)} What is the average fitness of an individual in the population
due to this allele? \\
 {\bf B)} What is the fitness of the child of a full-sib mating? \\
\end{question}
One consequence of this is that inbred individuals from usually outbred
populations may have lower fitnesses than outbred
individuals.  In typically outbred populations, the mean fitness of individuals
decreases with the inbreeding coefficient, i.e.\ this so-called inbreeding depression
is a common observation. This is wide-spread observation, dating back to systematic
surveys of inbreeding depression by \citeauthor{darwin:1876}.
Inbreeding depression is likely as primarily a consequence of being homozygous at many loci for
alleles with recessive deleterious effects.

One example of inbreeding
depression is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Silene_inbreeding}.  White
campion ({\it Silene latifolia}) is a dioecious flowering plant, dioecious means that the males and females are
separate individuals. \citeauthor{richards:00} performed crosses to
create offspring who were outbred, the offspring of half-sibs,
full-sibs, and of two generations of full-sib mating. He measured
their germination success, which is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:Silene_inbreeding}. Note how the fitness of individuals
declines with the level of inbreeding.

  inbreeding in {\it S. latifolia}. Each point is the mean seed germination rates for different
  family crosses.  Redrawn from \citeauthor{richards:00}. } \label{fig:Silene_inbreeding} 
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Purging the inbreeding load.}
Populations that regularly inbreed over sustained periods of time
are expected to partially purge this load of deleterious
alleles. This is because such populations have exposed many of these alleles
in a homozygous state, and so selection can more readily remove these alleles
from the population.

If the population has sustained inbreeding, such that individuals in the population have an inbreeding
coefficient $F$, deleterious alleles at each locus will find a
new equilibrium frequency. Assuming the model of mutation-selection
model, with this inbreeding is, the new equilbrium frequency is 
\begin{equation}
	q_e = \frac{\mu}{\big( h(1-f) + f \big) s}
\end{equation}
the frequency of the deleterious allele is decreased due to
the allele now being expressed, and therefore exposed to selection, in
homozygotes more often due to inbreeding.  All else being equal then
populations with a high degree of inbreeding with purge their load. 


\newpage
\subsection{Migration--selection balance}
Another reason for the persistence of deleterious alleles in a
population is that there is a constant influx of maladaptive alleles
from other populations where these alleles are locally adapted.
This seems unlikely to be as broad an explanation for the
persistence of deleterious alleles genome-wide as mutation-selection
balance. However, a brief discussion of such alleles is worthwhile as
it helps to inform our ideas about local adaptation.\\


\gc{Adaptation can occur over a range of geographic scales.}

Adaptation can potentially occur on much finer geographic scales
from kilometers down to meters in some species. On such scales
dispersal is surely rapidly moving alleles between environments, but
the adaptation is maintained by the continued action of selection. An
example of adaptation at fine-scales is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Zinc_mine}.. \gc{Jain and
  Bradshaw} studied the patterns of heavy-metal resistance in plants
on mine tailings and in nearby meadows, a set of classic studies of 
\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{Data showing the Zinc tolerance of {\it Anthoxanthum
odoratum} on and off of the Trelogan
Mine, Flintshire, North Wales. } \label{fig:Zinc_mine} 
\end{figure}




As a first pass at this lets consider a haploid two allele model with
two different populations, where the relative fitnesses of our alleles
are as follows
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
allele & $1$ & $2$ \\
\hline
population 1 & 1 & 1-s \\
population 2 & 1-s & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
As a simple model of migration lets suppose within a population a
fraction of $m$ individuals are migrants from the other population,
and $1-m$ individuals are from the same deme.\\

To quickly sketch a solution to this, we'll set up a situation analogous
to our mutation-selection balance model. To do this let's assume that selection is strong compared to migration ($s \gg m$) then allele
$1$ will be almost fixed in population $1$ and allele $2$ will be
almost fixed in population $2$. If that is the case,
migration changes the frequency of allele $2$ in population $1$ ($q_1$) by
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Mig.} q_1 \approx m
\end{equation}
while as noted above $\Delta_{S} q_1= -sq_1$, so that migration and
selection are at an equilibrium when $0 = \Delta_{S} q_1+
\Delta_{Mig.}q_1$, i.e. an equilibrium frequency of allele $2$ in
population $1$ of
\begin{equation}
q_{e,1} = \frac{m}{s}
\end{equation}
so that migration is playing the role of mutation and so
migration-selection balance (at least under strong selection) is
analogous to mutation selection balance.\\

We can use this same model by analogy for the case of
migration-selection balance in a diploid model, in that case we replace
our haploid $s$ by the cost to heterozygotes $hs$.

\begin{tcolorbox} 
\begin{question}
You are investigating a small river population of sticklebacks, which receives infrequent migrants from a very large marine population. At a set of (putatively) neutral biallelic markers the freshwater population has frequencies:\\
0.2, 0.7, 0.8\\
at the same markers the marine population has frequencies:\\
0.4, 0.5 and 0.7.\\
 From studying patterns of heterozygosity at a large collection of markers, you have estimated the long term effective size of your freshwater population is 2000 individuals.\\
{\bf A)}	What is $F_{ST}$ across these neutral markers in the freshwater population, with respect to the large marine population (i.e. treat the marine population as the total)?\\
{\bf B)} You are also studying an unlinked locus involved in the
regulation of salt uptake. In the marine population the ancestral
allele is at close to fixation, but in your river population the
derived allele is at 0.99 frequency. Estimate the selective
disadvantage of the ancestral allele in your river population. [Hint
how can you use neutral differentiation to estimate the migration rate?]
\end{question}
\end{tcolorbox}
 
\subsection{Some theory of the spatial distribution of allele
frequencies under deterministic models of selection}

Imagine a continuous haploid population spread out along a line. Individuals
disperse a random distance $\Delta x$ from its birthplace to the location where
it reproduces, where $\Delta x$ is drawn from the probability density $g(~)$.
To make life simple we will assume that $g(\Delta x)$ is normally distributed
with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma$, i.e. migration is unbiased an
individuals migrate an average distance of $\sigma$. \\

Our frequency of allele $2$ at time $t$ in the population at spatial location
$x$ is $q(x,t)$. Assuming that only dispersal occurs, how does our allele
frequency change in the next generation? Our allele frequency in the next
generation at location $x$ reflects the migration from different locations in
the proceeding generation. Our population at location $x$ receives a
contribution $g(\Delta x)q(x+\Delta x,t)$ of allele $2$ from the population at
location $x+\Delta x$, such that the frequency of our allele at $x$ in the next
generation is \begin{equation} q(x,t+1) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(\Delta
x)q(x+\Delta x,t) d \Delta x.  \end{equation}

To obtain $q(x+\Delta x,t)$, lets take a Taylor series expansion of $q(x, t)$

\begin{equation}
q(x+\Delta x,t) = q(x,t) + \Delta x \frac{dq(x,t)}{dx}+ \tfrac{1}{2}(\Delta x)^2 \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}+\cdots
\end{equation}

then

\begin{equation}
q(x,t+1) = q(x,t) +\left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta x g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x \right) \frac{dq(x,t)}{dx} + \tfrac{1}{2}\left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\Delta x)^2 g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x \right)  \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}+\cdots
\end{equation} 

$g(~)$ has a mean of zero so $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta x g(\Delta x) d
\Delta x =0$ and has variance $\sigma^2$ so $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\Delta
x)^2 g(\Delta x) d \Delta x = \sigma^2$ and all higher terms are zero (as all
high moments of the normal are zero). Looking at the change in frequency
$\Delta q(x,t) = q(x,t+1)-q(x,t)$ then 

\begin{equation}
\Delta q(x,t) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}
\end{equation} 

This is a diffusion equation, so that migration is acting to smooth
out allele frequency differences with a diffusion constant
of $\tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}$. This is exactly analogous to the equation
describing how a gas diffuses out to equal density, as both particles
in a gas and our individuals of type $2$ are performing Brownian
motion (blurring our eyes and seeing time as continuous). \\


We will now introduce fitness differences into our model and set the relative
fitnesses of allele $1$ and $2$ at location $x $ to be $1$ and $1+s\gamma(x)$.
To make progress in this model we'll have to assume that selection isn't too
strong i.e. $ s \gamma(x) \ll 1$ for all $x$. The change in
frequency of allele $2$ obtained within a generation due to selection is

\begin{equation}
q^{\prime}(x,t) - q(x,t) \approx s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \big( 1 - q(x,t) \big)
\end{equation}

i.e. logistic growth of our favoured allele at location $x$.  Putting our
selection and migration terms together we find \begin{equation} q(x,t+1) -
q(x,t) = s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \big( 1 - q(x,t) \big)+\frac{\sigma^2}{2}
\frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2} \label{eqn:fisherKPP} \end{equation} in deriving this we
have essentially assumed that migration acted upon our original frequencies
before selection and in doing so have ignored terms of the order of $\sigma s$.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/equilib_cline.png}
\end{center}
\caption{An equilibrium cline in allele frequency. Our individuals
  dispersal an average distance of $\sigma=1$km per generation, and our
allele $2$ has a relative fitness of $1+s$ and $1-s$ on either side of
the environmental change at $x=0$.} \label{fig:cline}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The cline in allele frequency associated with a sharp
  environmental transition.}
To make progress lets consider a simple model of location adaptation where the
environment abruptly changes. Specifically we assume that $\gamma(x)= 1$ for
$x<0$ and $\gamma(x)= -1$ for $x \geq 0$, i.e. our allele $2$ has a selective
advantage at locations to the left of zero, while this allele is at a
disadvantage to the right of zero. In this case we can get an equilibrium
distribution of our two alleles were to the left of $zero$ our allele $2$ is at
higher frequency, while to the right of zero allele $1$ predominates. As we
cross from the left to the right side of our range the frequency of our allele
$2$ decreases in a smooth cline.\\



%Under such a model the change in frequency of allele $2$ at location $x$ at time $t$,
%$q(x,t)$, over time follows the differential equation
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{dq(x,t)}{dt} = s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \left( 1 - q(x,t) \right) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}
%\end{equation}
%the first term on the right-hand side is the logistic growth of our
%favoured allele at location $x$, while the second term on the
%right-hand side is the diffusion of allele frequencies due to
%dispersal (i.e. dispersal is acting to spread out the effect of
%allele frequency change across populations). See below for how we
%derive this \gc{to be added}.\\

Our equilibrium spatial distribution of allele frequencies can be found by
setting the LHS of eqn. \eqref{eqn:fisherKPP} to zero to arrive at
\begin{equation}
s\gamma(x) q(x) \left( 1 - q(x) \right) = - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x)}{dx^2}
\end{equation}
We then could solve this differential equation with appropriate boundary
conditions ($q(-\infty)=1$ and $q(\infty) = 0$) to arrive at the
appropriate functional form to our cline. While we won't go into the
solution of this equation here, we can note that by dividing our
distance $x$ by $\ell=\sigma/\sqrt{s}$ we can remove the effect of our
parameters from the above equation. This compound parameter $\ell$ is the characteristic
length of our cline, and it is this parameter which determines over
what geographic scale we change from allele $2$ predominating to
allele $1$ predominating as we move across our environmental shift. \\

The width of our cline, i.e. over what distance do we make this shift
from allele $2$ predominating to allele $1$,
can be defined in a number of different ways. One simple way to define
the cline width, which is easy to define but perhaps hard to measure accurately, is the slope (i.e. the
tangent) of $q(x)$ at $x=0$. Under this definition the cline width is approximately $0.6
\sigma/\sqrt{s}$.\\
