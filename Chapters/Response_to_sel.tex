\chapter{The Response to Phenotypic Selection}
Evolution by natural selection requires:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variation in a phenotype
\item That survival is non-random with respect to this phenotypic
variation.
\item That this variation is heritable.
\end{enumerate}
Points 1 and 2 encapsulate our idea of Natural Selection, but evolution by natural
selection will only occur if the 3rd condition is also met. It is the
heritable nature of variation that couples change within a generation
due to natural selection to change across generations (evolutionary
change). \\

Let's start by thinking about the change within a generation due
to directional selection, where selection acts to change the mean
phenotype within a generation. For example, a decrease in mean height within a
generation, due to taller organisms having a lower chance of surviving
to reproduction than shorter organisms. Specifically, we'll denote our mean phenotype at
reproduction by $\mu_S$, i.e. after selection has acted, and our mean
phenotype before selection acts by $\mu_{BS}$. This second quantity may be hard to
measure, as obviously selection acts throughout the life-cycle, so it
might be easier to think of this as the mean phenotype if selection
hadn't acted. So the change in mean phenotype within a generation is $\mu_{S} - \mu_{BS}= S$.  \\

\begin{marginfigure}

\caption{{\bf Top.} Distribution of a phenotype in the parental population

  of the phenotypic distribution are selected to reproduce; the resulting shift
  in the phenotypic mean is $S$. {\bf Bottom.}  Phenotypic distribution of
  children of the selected parents; the shift in the mean phenotype is
$R. $}
\end{marginfigure}

We are interested in predicting the distribution of phenotypes in the next
generation. In particular, we are interested in the mean phenotype in
the next generation to understand how directional selection has
contributed to evolutionary change. We'll denote the mean phenotype in
offspring, i.e. the mean phenotype in the next generation before selection acts,
as $\mu_{NG}$. The change across generations we'll call the response
to selection $R$ and put this equal to $\mu_{NG}- \mu_{BS}$. \\


The mean phenotype in the next generation is
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \E \left( \E(X_{kid} | X_{mum},X_{dad}) \right)
\end{equation}
where the outer expectation is over possible pairs of randomly mating individuals
who survive to reproduce. We can use eqn. \ref{predict_kid} to obtain
an expression for this expectation:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \mu_{BS} +
\beta_{mid,kid} ( \E(X_{mid}) - \mu_{BS})
\end{equation}

\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Response_to_sel/Breeders_eqn.pdf}

\caption{A visual representation of the Breeder's equation. Regression of child's phenotype on parental mid-point phenotype ($V_A=V_E=1$). Under truncation selection, only individuals
  with phenotypes $>1$ (red) are bred.}
\end{marginfigure}

So to obtain $\mu_{NG}$ we need to compute $\E(X_{mid})$, the expected
mid-point phenotype of pairs of individuals who survive to
reproduce. Well this is just the expected phenotype in the individuals
who survived to reproduce ($\mu_{S}$), so
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \mu_{BS} +
h^2 (\mu_S - \mu_{BS})
\end{equation}
So we can write our response to selection as
\begin{equation}
R = \mu_{NG} -\mu_{BS}  =
h^2 (\mu_S - \mu_{BS}) = h^2 S \label{breeders_eqn}
\end{equation}
So our response to selection is proportional to our selection
differential, and the constant of proportionality is the narrow sense
heritability. This equation is sometimes termed the Breeder's
equation. It is a statement that the evolutionary change across
generations ($R$) is proportional to the change caused by directional selection
within a generation ($S$), and that the strength of this relationship is
determined by the narrow sense heritability ($h^2$). \\

\begin{question}
\citet{galen:96} explored selection on flower shape in
{\it P. viscosum}.  She found that plants with larger corolla flare
had more bumblebee visits, which resulted in higher seed set and a
$17\%$ increase in corolla flare in the plants contributing to the
next generation. Based on the data in Fig. \ref{fig:Galen_corolla}
what is the expected response in the next generation?
\end{question}




\paragraph{The long-term response to selection}
If our selection pressure is sustained over many generations, we can
use our breeder's equation to predict the response. If we are willing
to assume that our heritability does not change and we maintain a constant selection
gradient, then after $n$ generations our phenotype mean will have
shifted 
\begin{equation}
n h^2 S
\end{equation}
i.e. our population will keep up a linear response to selection.

\begin{question}
A population of red deer were trapped on Jersey (an island off of
England) during the last inter-glacial period. From the fossil record \cite{lister:89}
we can see that the population rapidly adapted to their new
conditions. Within 6,000 years they evolved from an estimated mean weight of
the population of 200kg to an estimated mean weight of 36kg (a 6 fold
reduction)! You estimate that the generation time
of red deer is 5 years and, from a current day population, that the narrow sense heritability of the
phenotype is 0.5.\\
{\bf A)}	Estimate the mean change per generation in the mean body weight. \\

{\bf B)}	Estimate the change in mean body weight caused by
selection within a generation. State your assumptions.\\

{\bf C)}	Assuming we only have fossils from the founding population and the population after 6000 years, should we assume that the calculations accurately reflect what actually occurred within our population?
\end{question}


\paragraph{Alternative formulations of the Breeder's equation.}
A change in mean phenotype within a generation occurs because of the
differential fitness of our organisms. To think more carefully about this change within a
generation, let's think about a simple fitness model where our phenotype affects the
viability of our organisms (i.e. the probability they survive to
reproduce). The probability that an individual has a phenotype $X$
before selection is $p(X)$, so that the mean phenotype before
selection is
\begin{equation}
\mu_{BS} = \E[X] =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) dx
\end{equation}
The probability that an organism with a phenotype $X$ survives to
reproduce is $w(X)$, and we'll think about this as the fitness of
our organism. The probability distribution of phenotypes in those who
do survive to reproduce is
\begin{equation}
\P(X | \textrm{survive}) =  \frac{p(x) w(x)}{
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) w(x) dx}.
\end{equation}
where the denominator is a normalization constant which ensures that
our phenotypic distribution integrates to one. The denominator also
has the interpretation of being the mean fitness of the population,
which we'll call $\wbar$, i.e.  
\begin{equation}
\wbar =  
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) w(x) dx.
\end{equation}


Therefore, we can write the mean phenotype in those who survive to
reproduce as
\begin{equation}
\mu_S = \frac{1}{\wbar}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) w(x) dx
\end{equation}

If we mean center our population, i.e. set the phenotype before
selection to zero, then
\begin{equation}
S= \frac{1}{\wbar}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) w(x) dx
\end{equation}
%if $\mu_S=0$. \erin{do you mean $\mu_{BS}=0$?} 
Inspecting this more closely, we can see that $S$ has
the form of a covariance between our phenotype $X$ and our fitness
$w(X)$ ($S = Cov(X, w(X))$). Thus our change in mean phenotype is directly a measure of the
covariance of our phenotype and our fitness. Rewriting our breeder's
equation using this observation we see
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{V_A}{V}  Cov(X,w(X))
\end{equation}
we see that the response to selection is due to the fact that our
fitness (viability) of our organisms/parents covaries with our phenotype, and
that our child's phenotype is correlated with our parent's phenotype. 

The phenotype-fitness covariance divided by the phenotypic variance, $Cov(X,w(X))/ V$, is the slope of the linear regression of phenotype on fitness. Let's call this slope the fitness gradient and denote it by $\beta$. Then, equivalently, we can write the breeder's equation as
\begin{equation}
R= V_A \beta
\end{equation}
i.e. we'll see a directional response to selection if there is a linear relationship of phenotype on fitness, and if there is additive genetic variance for the phenotype. 

As one example of a fitness gradient, in Figure \ref{fig:red_deer_fitness_grad}  the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of male Red Deer is plotted against the weight of their antlers. The red line gives the linear regression of fitness (LRS) on antler mass and the slope of this line is the fitness gradient ($\beta$).

\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The response of multiple traits to selection, the
  multivariate breeder's equation.}
We can generalize these results for multiple traits, to ask how selection on
multiple phenotypes plays out over short time intervals. \cite{lande:79} Considering two traits we can write our responses in both traits as
\begin{eqnarray}
R_1 & = V_{A,1} \beta_1 + V_{A,1,2} \beta_2 \nonumber \\
R_2 & = V_{A,2} \beta_2 + V_{A,1,2} \beta_1  \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
where the $1$ and $2$ index our two different traits. Here $V_{A,1,2}$ is our additive covariance between our traits. Our selection gradient for trait 1, $\beta_1$, represents the change in fitness changing trait 1 alone holding everything else constant. This is a statement that our response in any one phenotype is modified by selection on other traits that covary with that trait. This offers a good way to think about how genetic trade offs play out over short-term evolution.

We can also write this in matrix form. We can write
our change in the mean of our multiple phenotypes within a generation as the vector $\bf{S}$ and our response across multiple generations as
the vector $\bf{R}$. These two quantities are related by 
\begin{equation}
\bf{R} = \bf{G} \bf{V}^{-1} \bf{S} = \bf{G} \boldsymbol{ \beta}
\end{equation}
 where $\bf{V}$ and $\bf{G}$ are our matrices of the
 variance-covariance of phenotypes and additive genetic values
 (eqn. \eqref{G_matrix} \eqref{P_matrix}) and
 $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of selection gradients (i.e. the change within a generation as a fraction of the total phenotypic variance). 

\begin{question}
You collect observations of red deer within a generation, recording an
individual's number of offspring and phenotypes for a number of traits which are known to

As an example of correlated responses to selection, consider the  \citeauthor{wilkinson:93} selection experiment on Stalk-eyed
 flies ({\it Cyrtodiopsis  dalmanni}). Stalk-eyed flies have evolved amazingly long eye-stalks. In the lab, \citeauthor{wilkinson:93} established six populations of
 wild-caught flies and selected up and down on males eye-stalk to body
 size ratio for 10 generations (left plot in Figure
 \ref{fig:Stalk_eyed_response}). Despite the fact that he did not
 select on females, he saw a correlated response in the females from
 each of the lines (right plot), because of the genetic correlation
 between male and female body proportions.

{\bf B)} Assume that the additive genetic variance of male and female phenotypes are
equal and that there is no direct
selection on female body-proportion in this experiment, i.e. that all of
the response in females is due to correlated selection. Can you

\end{question}



\section{Some applications of the multivariate trait breeder's equation}

The multivariate breeders equation has a lot of different uses in understanding the response of multiple traits to selection. It also offers some insights into kin selection and sexual selection. We'll discuss these next.

\paragraph{Hamiliton's Rule and the evolution of altruistic and selfish behaviours}
\marginnote{\citet{smith1964kin} coined the name kin selection to describe Hamilton's approach to this problem. It's also sometimes called the inclusive fitness approach, as we need to include not just one individual's fitness but the weighted sum of all the fitness of all their relatives. }
Individuals frequently behave in ways that sacrifice their own fitness for the
benefit of others. That selection favours such apparent acts of altruism is puzzling at first sight. \citet{hamilton1964genetical,hamilton1964genetical2} supplied the first general evolutionary explanation of such altruism. 
His intuition was that while an individual is losing out of some reproductive output, the alleles underlying an altruistic behaviour can still spread in the population if this cost is outweighed by benefits gained 
through the transmission of these alleles through a related individual. Note that this means that the
allele is not acting in an self-sacrificing manner, even though individuals may as a result. 
 \begin{marginfigure}

  honeydew collected by their nest mates, till they swell to the size
  of grapes, and used as a food storage
  device. } \label{fig:turkey}
\end{marginfigure} 


Altruism reflects social interactions. So as a simple model let's imagine that individuals interact in pairs, with our focal
individual $i$ being paired with an individual $j$. This could be pairs of siblings interacting.   
Imagine that individuals have two possible phenotypes $X=1$ or $0$,
corresponding to providing or withholding some small act of `altruism'
(we could just as easily flip these labels and call them an unselfish
act and a selfish act respectively). 
Our pairs of individuals interacting could, for example, be siblings sharing a
nest. The altruistic trait could be as simple as growing at a slightly slower rate so as to reducing sibling-competition for food from
parents, or more complicated acts of altruism such as children foregoing their own reproduction so as to help their parents raise their siblings.



Providing the altruistic act has a cost $C$ to the fitness of our individual and failing to provide this act has no cost. Receiving this altruistic act confers a fitness benefit $B$ over individuals who did not receive this act. \citeauthor{hamilton1964genetical}'s rule states that such a trait will spread through the population if 
\begin{equation}
 2F B > C 
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the average kinship coefficient between the interacting
individuals ($i$ and $j$). In the usual formulation of Hamilton's Rule our $2F$ is replaced by the `Coefficient of relationship', which is the
  proportion of alleles shared between the individuals. Here we use
  two times the kinship coefficient to keep things inline with our 
  notation for these chapters. Note that if our individuals are themselves inbred we need
to do a little more careful to reconcile these two measures.
So the altruistic behaviour will spread even if it is costly to the individual if its cost is paid off by the benefit to sufficiently related individuals. 

As one example of kin-selection consider \citet{krakauer2005kin}'s work on
co-operative courtship in wild turkeys ({\it Meleagris
  gallopavo}). Male turkeys often form display
partnerships, with a subordinate male helping a dominant male with
displaying to females and defending the females from other groups of males. \begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{illustration_images/Quant_gen/Turkey/turkey.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Turkey  ({\it Meleagris
  gallopavo}). Bilder-atlas zur Wissenschaftlich-populären
Naturgeschichte der Vögel in ihren sämmtlichen Hauptformen (1864). Wien,K.K. Hof } \label{fig:turkey}
\end{marginfigure}  These pairs are often full brothers ($F=0.25$),
with the subordinate male often being the younger of the two. The
subordinate male often loses out on mating opportunities over their
entire lifetime by acting as a wingman to their older 
brothers. \citet{krakauer2005kin} estimated that dominant males gained
an extra $6.1$ offspring when they display with a partner than males
who display alone. While the subordinate males lose out on fathering $0.9$
offspring compared to solitary males. Thus the costs of helping by
subordinate males is more than compensated by the fitness gains of
their brothers ( $ (2 \times 0.25)  \times 6.1 > 0.9$), and so the
evolution of this  altruistic  helping in co-operative courtship is potentially well explained by kin-selection \citep[see ][for more analysis]{akccay2016}.
\begin{question}
How would this answer be changed if the male Turkey partnerships were only
$\nicefrac{1}{2}$ sibs, or first cousins?
\end{question}


\begin{marginfigure}

\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{figures/Response_to_sel/Hamiltons_rule_B_C.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Top)} The fitness of individual $i$ as a function of their behavioural phenotype, where altruistic/non-altruistic behavioural phenotypes are encoded as $1$ and $0$ respectively. The direct fitness cost of behaving altruistically is $C$. {\bf Bottom)} The fitness of our focal individual $i$ as a function of the behavioural phenotype of their interacting partner ($j$). Our focal individual gets an increase $B$ in fitness if their partner behaves altruistically.} \label{fig:Hamilton_B_C}
\end{marginfigure}


To sketch a proof of this result, let's assume that our focal $i$ individual's fitness can be written as 
\begin{equation}
W(i,j)= W_0 + W_i +W_j
\end{equation}
where $W_i$ is the contribution of the fitness of the individual $i$ due
to their own phenotype, and $W_j$ is the contribution to our
individual $i$'s fitness due to the interacting individual $j$'s behaviour (i.e. $j$'s phenotype).
With the benefit $B$ and cost $C$, our $W(i,j)$ are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Hamilton_B_C}. 
Where does this result come from? Well, we can use our quantitative genetics framework to gain some 
intuition by deriving a simple version of Hamilton's Rule by thinking
about the phenotypes of an individual's kin as genetically correlated
phenotypes. 

\marginnote{ Here we've following a simplified version of
  \citet{queller1992quantitative}'s treatment, to re-derive Hamilton's rule in a quantitative genetics framework (Hamilton's original papers did this in a population genetics framework).}
Following our multivariate breeder's equation, we can write the expected change of our behavioural phenotype as 
\begin{equation}
R = \beta_i V_A + \beta_j V_{A,i,j},
\end{equation}
Our altruistic phenotype is increasing in the population if $R>0$, i.e. if 
\begin{equation}
  \beta_i V_A + \beta_j V_{A,i,j}  > 0 \end{equation}
The slope $\beta_i$ of the regression of our focal individual's
behavioural phenotype on fitness is proportional to $-C$. The slope
$\beta_j$ of the regression of our interacting partner's phenotype on
our focal individual's fitness is proportional to $B$ (with the same
constant of proportionality). Therefore, our altruistic phenotype is increasing in the population if
\begin{eqnarray}
  \beta_i V_A + \beta_j V_{A,i,j} & > 0  \nonumber  \\
 B \frac{V_{A,i,j}}{V_A} & >  C
\end{eqnarray}
So what's the average genetic covariance between
individual $i$ and $j$'s altruistic phenotype? Well it's the same behavioural phenotype in both individuals, so the phenotypes are genetically correlated if our individuals are related to each other. The covariance of the same phenotype between two individuals is just $2 F_{i,j} V_A$ (see \eqref{additive_covar_general_rellys}). So our altruistic phenotype is increasing in the population if 
\begin{eqnarray}
   & B\frac{2 F_{i,j} V_A}{V_A} &> C \nonumber  \\
  2 F_{i,j} B & > C 
\end{eqnarray}

Seen from this perspective, \citeauthor{hamilton1964genetical}'s rule
is simply a statement that altruistic behaviours can spread via
kin-selection, if the average cost to an individual of carrying altruistic alleles is paid back through the average benefit of interacting with altruistic relatives (kin)


%\erin{this phrasing is a little misleading because it's 'paid back' to the allele, but not to the individual. I'd suggest something like 'if the fitness cost of altruism to an allele is paid back on average through the benefits of interacting with altruistic relatives (kin).


\paragraph{Sexual selection and the evolution of mate preference by indirect benefits. }


Organisms often put an enormous effort into finding and attracting mates, sometimes at
a considerable cost to their chances of survival. Why are individuals so choosy about who they mate with, particularly when their choice seems to be based on elaborate characters and arbitrary displays
that surely lower the viability of their mates?  

\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}

    noctiluca}). The animal kingdom : arranged after its organization;

\end{marginfigure}

\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{Journal_figs/Quant_gen/glow_worm_flashes/glow_worm_flashes.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Female Glow worms who have the largest, and therefore
  brightest, lanterns have the highest fecundity. Data from \citet{hopkins2015m}. } \label{fig:glow_worms_lantern}
\end{marginfigure}


One major reason why individuals evolve to be choosy about who they mate with is that it can directly impact their fitness. By choosing a mate with
particular characteristics, individuals can gain more parental care for
their offspring, avoid parasites, or be choosing a mate with higher fertility. For example,  female glow-worms flash at night to attract males flying by. Females with larger, brighter lanterns have higher fecundity, so
males with a preference for brighter flashes will gain a direct benefit to their own fitness. (Note that males will benefit even if these differences in female fecundity are entirely driven by differences in environment, and so none heritable.) Indeed male glow worms have evolved to be attracted to brighter
flashing lures.  

However, even in the absence of direct benefits of choice, selection can still indirectly favour the evolution of choosiness. These
indirect benefits occur because individuals can have higher fitness
offspring by choosing a mate whose phenotype indicates high viability
(the so-called good genes hypothesis), or by choosing a mate whose
phenotype is simply attractive, and likely to produce similarly
attractive offspring (the `runaway' or sexy sons hypothesis).

We'll denote a display trait, e.g. tail length, in males by $\mars$ and a preference
trait in females by $\venus$. Our display trait is under direct selection in males, such that its response to selection can be written as
\begin{equation}
R_{\mars} = \beta_{\mars} V_{A, \mars}
\end{equation}
Let's assume that the female preference trait, the degree to which
females are attracted to long tails, is not under direct
selection $\beta_{\venus}=0$. Then the response to selection of the
preference trait can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
R_{\venus} &=\beta_{\venus}V_{A,\venus}  + \beta_{\mars} V_{A, \venus
  \mars}
& = \beta_{\mars} V_{A, \venus  \mars}
\end{eqnarray}
So the female preference will respond to selection if it is
genetically correlated with the male trait, i.e. if $V_{A, \venus
  \mars}$ is not zero. There's a number of different ways this genetic correlation could arise; the
simplest is that the loci underlying the male trait may have a
pleiotropic effect on female preference. However, female preference
may often have quite a distinct genetic basis from male display traits.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Response_to_sel/Genetic_corr_assort_mating.pdf}
\end{center} \label{fig:assort_mating_2_trait}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

A more general way in which trait-preference genetic correlations may arise is through assortative mating. As females vary in their
tail-length preference, the ones with a preference for longer
tails will mate with long-tailed males and the opposite for females
with a preference for shorter-tails. Therefore, a
genetic correlation between mates display and preference traits will
become established (see Figure \ref{fig:assort_mating_2_trait}). 

The males with the longer tails will also carry the alleles
associated with the preference for longer tails, as their long-tailed
dads tended to mate with females with a genetic preference for long
tails. Similarly, the the males with shorter tails will carry alleles associated with the preference for
shorter tails. Thus if there is direct selection for males with longer tails, then
the female preference for longer tails will increase too, as it is
genetically correlated via assortative mating.

As an example of how direct selection on display traits can drive the
evolution of preference traits, let's consider some data from
guppies. Guppies ({\it Poecilia reticulata}) are a classic system for
studying the interplay of natural and sexual selection. In some populations of
guppies, females show a preference for males with more orange
colouration. \citeauthor{houde:94} established four replicate
population pairs of guppies and selected one of each pair for
an increased or decreased orange coloration in males, selecting the top/bottom $20$ out of $50$
males. She randomly chose females from each population to form the next generation, and so did not
exert direct selection on females. She measured the response to 
selection on male colouration and on female preference for orange (left
and right panels of Figure \ref{fig:assort_mating_guppies}
respectively). In the lines that were selected for more orange males
females showed an increased preference for orange. While in those
lines that she selected males for less orange in their display females
showed a decreased preference for orange. This is consistent with indirect selection on female orange preference as a response to
selection on male colouration, due to a genetic correlation between
female preference and male trait. It is {\it a priori} unlikely
that pleiotropy is the source of the genetic correlation between these
traits, rather it is likely caused by females assortative mating with
males that match their colour preference. 




Returning to our bird tail example, what could drive the direct
selection on male tail length? The selection for longer tails in males could come about because
longer tails are genetic correlated with higher male viability, for
example perhaps only males who gather an excess of food have the
resources to invest in growing long tail, i.e. a long tail is an
honest signal. This would be a good genes explanation of female mate
choice evolution.

because it affords good evidence that the most refined beauty may
serve as a sexual charm, and for no other purpose.'' -- \citet{darwin1888descent}
\end{quote} }

There's another subtler way that selection could favour our male
trait. Imagine that the variation in female preference trait is
because some females have no strong preference for the male-tail
length, but some females have a strong preference for males with
longer tails. Males with longer tails would then have higher fecundity than
the short-tailed males as there's a subset of females who are strongly
attracted to long tails, and these males also get to mate with the
other females. Thus selection favours long-tailed males, and so indirectly favours
female preference for longer tails; females with a preference
for longer-tails have sons who in turn who are more attractive. This
model is sometimes called the sexy-son model. It is also called
the Fisherian runaway model \citep{fisher1915evolution}, as female
preference and male trait can coevolve in an escalating fashion
driving more and more extreme preferences for arbitrary traits. Thus
many extravagant display traits in males and females may exist purely
because individuals find them beautiful and are attracted to them. 



%\erin{I don't take away from this description that you can get runaway sexual selection without external directional selection for longer tails ... can you make that more clear? I think the problem is making the female trait a preference for short vs. long tails when maybe it should be presented as a preference for long tails vs. no preference so the males with longer tails get a boost from positive sexual selection. Also, why do you plot mean daughter's trait against mean son's trait and not, say, mean father's trait against mean daughter's trait or increase in population prevalence or correlation between male-female traits over time?}
