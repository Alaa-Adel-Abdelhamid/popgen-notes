# Population Genetics Notes

This is the latex source, images, and R code for the population genetics notes
by Graham Coop. 

Theses notes, code, and all of the figures are released under the Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. So if you do reuse these you don’t
need my permission, you just need to acknowledge where you got them from. 
The R code associated with these notes are released under the MIT license. 

There are still many typos in these notes, but I hope to fix them over time,
and feel free to contact me or leave a comment here.

This book was developed from my set of notes for the [Population Biology graduate group](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/) core class (PBGG) and Undergraduate Population and
  Quantitative Genetics class (EVE102) at UC Davis. Thanks to the many
  students who've read these notes and suggested improvements. Thanks to Simon Aeschbacher, Vince Buffalo, and Erin Calfee who read
 and extensively edited earlier drafts of these notes. To illustrate these notes I've used old scientific and natural history illustrations, in part
 because they are out of copyright but mainly because they bring me joy. Many of the old images come from
[Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) a consortium of natural history institutions that are
 digitizing their collections and make them freely available online. If you enjoy the images consider donating to the
[BHL](http://library.si.edu/donate-bhl). Many of the data and simulation graphics in the book were prepared in R,
 the code for each is linked to from the caption of each figure. In many cases data were extracted from old figures using the
 [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/)
 tool, as such I advise re-extracting the data if you wish to use it
 for research purposes.


There are various other popgen notes openly available online. Here’s a couple of other resources:
