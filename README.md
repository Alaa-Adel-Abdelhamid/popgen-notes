Population genetics notes

This is the latex source, images, and R code for the population genetics notes by Graham Coop. 
A fuller description of this resource is available at my website http://gcbias.org/population-genetics-notes/

Theses notes, code, and all of the figures are released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. 
So if you do reuse these you donâ€™t need my permission, you just need to acknowledge where oyu got them from.
My intention is that these notes can provide a resource for others to write their own versions
of these notes. 

There are still many typos in these notes, but I hope to fix them over time, 
and feel free to contact me or leave a comment here.

I hope to develop these notes into a fuller resource over the coming years,
to create an up to date open source population genetics textbook.

Graham
