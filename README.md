# Population Genetics Notes

A pdf of the notes can be downloaded from the [third release (v1.2)](https://github.com/cooplab/popgen-notes/releases). Please use that as a stable release. If you want to use a beta version, which will be more up to date but subject to change use the [release_popgen_notes.pdf](https://github.com/cooplab/popgen-notes/blob/master/release_popgen_notes.pdf).

If you use these notes and find them helpful please consider taking a moment to fill out this [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKOrWLsOa5Ao9JgosXPhdLEpvewxi86Y_9Jt_Vnibn0lELng/viewform?usp=sf_link). I'm collecting this information in case it is useful in supporting future development of the notes.

This book was developed from my set of notes for the [Population Biology graduate group](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/) core class (PBGG) and Undergraduate Population and Quantitative Genetics class (EVE102) at UC Davis. Thanks to the many
  students who've read these notes and suggested improvements. Thanks to Simon Aeschbacher, Vince Buffalo, Erin Calfee, and Michael Whitlock who read
 and extensively edited earlier drafts of these notes. To illustrate these notes I've used old scientific and natural history illustrations, in part
 because they are out of copyright but mainly because they bring me joy. Many of the old images come from
[Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) a consortium of natural history institutions that are
 digitizing their collections and make them freely available online. If you enjoy the images consider donating to the
[BHL](http://library.si.edu/donate-bhl). Many of the data and simulation graphics in the book were prepared in R,
 the code for each is linked to from the caption of each figure. In many cases data were extracted from old figures using the
 [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/)
 tool, as such I advise re-extracting the data if you wish to use it
 for research purposes.
