\subsubsection{Hamiliton's Rule and the evolution of altruistic and
  selfish behaviours}
So lets imagine that individuals interact in pairs, with our focal
individual $i$ being paired with an individual $j$.  
Imagine that individuals have two possible phenotypes $X=1$ or $0$,
corresponding to providing or withholding some small act of `Altruism'
(we could just as easily flip these labels and call them a unselfish
act and a selfish act respectively). 


We will assume that our focal $i$ individual's relative fitness can be written as 
\begin{equation}
W(X_i,X_j)= W_0 + W_i +W_j
\end{equation}
where $W_i$ is the contribution of the fitness of the individual $i$ due
to this phenotype, and $W_j$ is the contribution to our
individual $i$'s fitness due to the $j$'s behaviour (i.e. phenotype).

Providing the altruistic act has a cost $C$ to the fitness of our
individual, with failing to provide this act has no cost. Receiving this
altruistic act confers a fitness benefit $B$ (not receiving it has no benefit).
With these benefits and costs our $W(X_i,X_j)$ are depicted in 

Now we can write our fitness component for our individual's fitness
as 
\begin{equation}
W_i = \alpha_i + \beta_{W_i P_i} X_i + \epsilon_{W_i}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
W_j = \alpha_j + \beta_{W_j P_j} P_j + \epsilon_{W_j}
\end{equation}
our slopes $\beta_{W_i P_i} = Cov(W_i,P_i)/Var(P_i)$ and $\beta_{W_j
  P_j} = Cov(W_j,P_j)/Var(P_j)$ i.e. the regression our our individual
$i$s fitness components on his and his neighbour's phenotype. From 
Figure XXX these slopes are just our cost and benefit.


Using the price equation, assuming that the residuals are not
correlated with 
\begin{equation}
\delta \bar{G}_X = \beta_{W_i P_i} Cov(G_i,P_i) +  \beta_{W_j P_j} Cov(G_i,P_j) 
\end{equation}

where $\beta_{W_i P_i} =Cov(W_i,P_i)/Var(P_i)$ and $\beta_{W_j P_j}
=Cov(W_j,P_j)/Var(P_j)$ are the slopes of the components of our individual $i$'s fitness 
against the phenotypes of individual $i$ and $j$
